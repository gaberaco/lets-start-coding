/* 
 *  The Makerscreen library makes controlling the 16x2 LED screen
 *  easy, with a collection of simple methods to control it.
 *  
 *  NOTE: This code will not compile or upload! It's designed to show
 *  you how the methods work and what arguments they need. Take a method
 *  or two from the loop() and use them in an example program to see 
 *  how they work.
